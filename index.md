# Lab Report 4

In this Lab Report, I am going to document me reproducing the task from the competion. I will begin with Step 4 of the task. 

- Log into ieng6

Keys pressed: `<up><enter>`

The `ssh cs15lwi23arn@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command is what logs me into my ieng6 account, and because I have an SSH key for my account on my Mac, I do not have to enter my password. This command was just recently used, so that is why I only had to press `<up>` once to access it in my history. 

- Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

Keys pressed: `g i t  c l o n e  <Command-V><enter>`

The `git clone git@github.com:igerth/lab7.git` command clones my fork of the repository `lab7` in my GitHub account. I had to type `git clone` out and the `<Command-V>` shortcut pasted my GitHub repo link that I had copied. 

- Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

Keys pressed: `c d  l<tab> <up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>, <up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`

First, I had to `cd` into the `lab7` directory. Then, the `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` command was seven up in my history, so I used the up arrow to access it. Last, the `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests` command was seven up in my history, so again I used the up arrow to access it. 

- Edit the code file to fix the failing test
